# How to Contribute to the project

### If you are a first time user and have just cloned the repository, you can skip these couple of steps

`git checkout master` To switch to master branch of your local repo.
`git pull origin master` This will update the master branch of your local repo with the latest changes in the master branch of this git repo.

### Now to making changes and contributing

First add an issue in Gitlab about the changes you would like to make. The issue will be assigned an issue number.

Then make a new branch in your local repo, with its name starting with issue number.

For e.g. `git checkout -b n-name-of-the-branch` where 'n' is the issue number.

After that's done, you may make the changes you would like to.

Then,

`git add .`
`git commit -m "Commit message"`
`git push origin <branch-name>`

Create a merge request after that for the changes to be reflected in the master branch.

And that's how you contribute to this project.

HAPPY CODING!
